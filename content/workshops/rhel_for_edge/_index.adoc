= Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Edge Workshop

== Workshop Description
This workshop will have you creating RHEL for Edge OSTree-based
operating system images, deploying those images to a simulated edge
device, deploying and updating a container web application on the
edge device, and finally, performing automated atomic upgrades and
rollbacks of the operating system.

== Who should attend

-   Architects
-   Developers
-   Technical Leads
-   Operations Engineers


== What you will learn

- Defining and managing operating system image blueprints
- Using CLI tools to build and inspect an operating system image
- Using the RHEL web console to build and inspect an operating system image
- Configuring and installing an OSTree-based edge device
- Automatically restarting container applications and keeping them up to date
- Updating the operating system atomically with automated rollbacks on failure

== Overview
Welcome to the workshop! This particular workshop will give you
hands-on experience working with OSTree-based atomic operating
system images and deployements. You'll explore how RHEL for Edge
simplifies the installation and maintenance of an atomic operating
system and how systemd combined with podman simplifies the lifecycle
of applications at the edge.

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through
and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your
own, just go through the list of labs below in order (as some build
off of each other).

== Your Responsibilities

Have a Discussion. This will be boring if itâ€™s just us, up here talking for over 4 hours.

Participate. We are going to cut you loose with RHEL, in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy. See? Not only can we dig into RHEL, but you can make a new friend!
