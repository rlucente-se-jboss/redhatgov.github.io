= That's it!
These labs provided you some idea of how RHEL for Edge simplifies
the lifecycle of both an atomic operating system and the applications
it hosts. You should have a deeper understanding of the various
components that work together to build, deploy, and update the
operating system. Additionally, you should now understand how podman
combined with systemd can run container applications on lightweight
infrastructure. Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires"
in the demo environment we've setup and explore both the web console
and the `composer-cli` command line tooling.
